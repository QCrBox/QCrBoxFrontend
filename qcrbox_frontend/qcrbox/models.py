'''QCrBox Models

The collection of Model classes which determine the structure of the Frontend
database and provide the endpoints from which to run queries.

class FileMetaData(models.Model):
    '''The FileMetaData model stores information on Datasets; the actual files
    that make up a Dataset are handled exclusively in the backend and are only
    touched by the frontend when uploading a new file or downloading a file
    from the backend via the frontend.

    The FileMetaData model allows the frontend to keep track of Datasets
    vicariously, including information on their history, ownership, date
    of creation and the ID by which they are stored on the backend.

    Contains the following attributes:
    - filename(str): the name of the filename, matching the name of the
            Datafile within the Dataset created in the backend upon uploading
            a new file from the frontend
    - display_filename(str): the filename to be displayed by the frontend.
            Generally the same as filename, but with a bracketed number (e.g.
            (2) ) appended to the end of it in cases where files would
            otherwise have the same name.  Helps to prevent user ambiguity.
    - backend_uuid(str): the ID string pointing to where the Dataset is stored
            on the backend
    - user(User): the User object of the user that uploaded this file or
            created it as output from an Interactive Session.
    - group(Group): the Group object of the group to which this file is
            associated.
    - filetype(str): the filetype (e.g. extension) of the file
    - creation_time(datetime): the date/time the file was created
    - active(bool): a flag to indicate whether the file is 'active'.  This
            is set to False when the corresponding Dataset has been deleted
            from the backend, and massively limits the functionality
            available when working with this dataset (e.g. it cannot be
            selected to start a workflow, it won't show up when viewing the
            list of files, etc).
