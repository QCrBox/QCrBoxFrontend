# [`schema.svg`](schema.svg) and [`schema.png`](schema.png)

The Schema diagram shows the structure of the database implemented for the QCrBox Frontend.  For each table in the database (e.g. type of data stored), it lists all the fields along with the type of data stored in each one.  Where tables are connected through the use of Foreign Keys, these are shown by connections between tables, along with indications as to whether these connections are e.g. one-to-many or many-to-many etc.  Does not include some backend tables automatically generated by django or plotly (e.g. permissions) which are not modified directly at any point in the QCrBox Frontend code.

# [`schema.txt`](schema.txt)
